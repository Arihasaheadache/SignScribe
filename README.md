# SignScribe
A hand sign translation model using Neural Networks

## Why are you re-inventing the wheel?

Because I wanna learn how to make wheels, duh... All things aside, my fascination with sign language has been evident from the very start. Also, now that AI/ML is becoming a hot topic, I felt like building my own neural networks and ml models and replacing the ones I use here would be a nice learning curve.

## How does it work?

As I update the app, I will probably also update the readme file, so keep in touch ig :]
